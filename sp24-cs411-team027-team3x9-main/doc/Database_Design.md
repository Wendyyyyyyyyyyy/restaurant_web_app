## Relations

### HappensAround
- Crime events happen around the restaurants In the crime table, each row represents a number of crime events with the same type near a specific location. Therefore, for each row in crime, it could be near zero or one or more restaurants. Similarly, for each restaurant, it could be near zero or one or more crime locations. Therefore, there is a zero or many to zero or many relationship between Restaurants entity and Crimes entity. 

### Has
- A restaurant serves different dishes. For each restaurant, it could possibly serve one or more dishes. It could also have zero dish in our database, which indicates we do not have any information about the dish about this particular restaurant. In contrast, for each dish, it cannot exist without the restaurant. (There is an underlying assumption that although different restaurants could name a cuisine exactly the same name, we still recognize them as internally different as they do have independent recipes and attributes such as prices.) Therefore, we have a one to zero or many relationship between the Restaurant entity and the Dish entity.

### At (Restaurant and Location)
- A restaurant has its location. For each restaurant, it can only have exactly one locations. However, several restaurants can share the same location since there might be some shopping mall or food court containing one than one restaurants. In addition, there is also another possibility that we have a location which is stored in our crime data base but there is no restaurants in that region. Therefore, there is an exactly one to zero or many relationship between Restaurants entity and Crimes entity.

### At (Crime and Location)
- A Crimes has its location. For each Crime, it can only have exactly one locations. However, several Crimes can share the same location. In addition, there is also another possibility that we have a location which is stored in our restaurant data base but there is no Crime in that region.  Therefore, there is a zero or many to one relationship between Crimes entity and Location entity. 

### Review
- Restaurants are reviewed by users. Each user can have zero or multiple reviews, and a restaurant can also has many reviews or no reviews at all (maybe itâ€™s new). A review should contain text (the thoughts of the customers), the star (0~5, the overall rating), and the review time.
